--~ 112) Go a tiny bit NE, just outside the eco-dome, to the Ruins of Farahlon and start killing eyes and houds

--~ "Surveying the Ruins" maker one is placed at 51,20 marker 2 is placed on the other side (not up higher)

--~ like me the first time. I thought you only need 5 gases to shut down 5 reavers and after turning in one I

--~ complete LOL
--~ 114) Go down to Tuluman's Landing at 34,38 and at Kaylaan turn in "Outside Assistance" accept "A Dark
--~ Pact" then go to Tuluman and accept "Dealing with the Foreman" then to Oazul and accept "Neutralizing

--~ 115) While around Ara you need to kill Gan'arg Warp-Tinkerers (near top outside and in cave), Daughters
--~ of Destiny (near nethermancers outside), and Mo'arg Warp-Masters (near top inside and outside and in

--~ Netherstorm 69-70
--~ 123) Now similar to the last quest with mutating the lashers, you have to attack either Talbuk does or sires
--~ until they're 20% or less on life, then use the talbuk tagger on them for "Creatures of the Eco-Domes" It
--~ doesn’t kill them it just knocks them out but they won’t attack when they get back up. It’s possible to stay
--~ in the same camp of talbuks to finish this since you don’t kill them
--~ 124) Once you're done with this head back to Aurine Moonblaze near the elevator and turn it in and accept
--~ "When Nature Goes Too Far"

--~ and turn it in
--~ 126) Go south to Tuluman's Landing at 34,38 and go to Kaylaan and turn in "A Dark Pact" accept "Aldor No
--~ More"
--~ 127) Go to Tuluman and turn in "Dealing with the Overmaster" then beside him turn in "Neutralizing the
--~ Nethermancers"
--~ 128) Go NW into Forge Base: Gehenna at 39,21 and start killing wrathbringers for "The Best Defense"
--~ 129) Go NE into Eco-Dome Farfield at 44,14 to Tashar and turn in "Testing the Prototype" accept "All
--~ Clear!" and start killing the raptors for it and collecting the dome generator segments for "Retrieving the
--~ Goods" they're just laying on the ground next to a few eggs, not really in a nest like you'd think that is
--~ guarded. Once you're done head back to Tashar at 44,14 and turn in "All Clear!" then wait for him to do
--~ his repairs and accept "Success!"
--~ 130) Run back down to Stormspire and up the elevator go to Ghabar and turn in "Success!"
--~ 131) Go between the left building and the upramp to Nauthis and turn in "The Best Defense" accept
--~ "Teleport This!" then go up the ramp to Audi the Needle and turn in "Retrieving the Goods"
--~ 132) Go back west to Forge Base: Gehenna and get near each teleporter and use the mental interference
--~ rod on the cyber-rage forgelords for "The Best Defense". The western teleporter is at 39,20 the central
--~ teleporter is at 41,18 and the eastern teleporter is at 44,20
--~ 133) Go back to Stormspire to Nauthis and turn it in
--~ 134) Fly to Area 52 and go in the Inn to Orelis and turn in "Aldor No More" then hearth back to Stormspire
--~ 135) You should be 25-30% to 70
--~ 136) Run NE through the Ruins of Farahlon over the bridge into Protectorate Watch Post at 58,31
--~ 137) As you enter talk to Wind Trader Marid and accept "A Not-So-Modest Proposal"
--~ 138) Up some more at Navuud accept "Electro-Shock Goodness!" then next to him from Ameer accept "The
--~ Ethereum"
--~ 139) Then up at Dabiri accept "Recipe for Destruction" then from Viridius, who walks around, accept
--~ "Captain Tyralius"
--~ 140) Drink Navuud’s Concoction and hit the void wastes to split them into globules for the first part of
--~ "Electro-Shock Goodness!" down in the staging grounds where we’re about to go
--~ 141) Go just south of here into the Ethereum Staging Grounds at 56,38 and start killing for "The
--~ Ethereum" Captain Zovax wanders around. Once you're done you have to use the transponder zeta at
--~ 56,38 and Ameer will appear. Turn it in and accept "Ethereum Data" then to the south a tiny bit at 55,39
--~ is the data cell, grab it and go turn it in to Ameer at the portal and accept "Potential For Brain Damage=
--~ High"
--~ 142) Now you have to kill the guys for their essence. Drink the essence and you have a 30 second buff to
--~ see the fish like relays floating around that you have to kill for the relay data. You should be able to get 1-
--~ 2 datas per essence you drink
--~ 143) Turn it back in to Ameer at the portal and accept "S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E" then kill an archon or overlord
--~ until you get a prepared ethereum wrapping then go back to the teleporter and turn it in and accept
--~ "Delivering the Message" and protect the demolitionist (easiest way is to either clear it first, or let stuff
--~ attack him. It does that thing where it chases him but doesn’t hit him) then go back to the teleporter and
--~ turn it in and SKIP the next part
--~ 144) Just a bit SW there is warden Icoshock, kill him for the key but don't use it on any of the prisons
--~ around him. They're duds. The real prison is just behind the Nexus-King Salhadaar at 53,41 open it for
--~ "Captain Tyralius"
--~ 145) Go east to 59,45 and speak with Araxes and accept "The Flesh Lies..." then enter the mine, Access
--~ Shaft Zeon and use the lighter on the withered corpses. Don't get too close or they spawn into parasitic
--~ fleshbeasts. As you enter the tunnel you can go left, keep left until you end up at 60,41 and you'll see Ya
--~ six and the power pack, accept "Arconus the Insatiable" and he’ll give you his hologram to help then grab
--~ the power pack for "A Not-So-Modest Proposal" then go back up towards the entrance and go deeper in,
--~ staying right until you hit the big room at 60,39 and kill Arconus the Insatiable then leave the cave and
--~ return to Araxes just outside at 59,45 and turn in "The Flesh Lies..."
--~ 146) Go up around Manaforge Ultris and drink Navuud's Concoction and hit the seeping sludges to split
--~ them into globules for the other part of "Electro-Shock Goodness!" also kill the unstable voidwraiths and
--~ the voidshriekers here for "Recipe for Destruction"
--~ 147) Go to 66,33 and you should get the complete message for "Triangulation Point One" if not use the
--~ triangualtion device and a hunters mark will appear where you have to stand
--~ 148) Go east into the Celestial Ridge and down the long path through the nether drakes and at the bottom
--~ at 70,39 you'll see the teleporter right as the ramp down ends. Use it and Marid will appear, turn in "A
--~ Not-So-Modest Proposal" accept "Getting Down to Business"
--~ 149) Now go around kill any of the nether drakes or dragons for their essence for this then turn it in at the
--~ Shrouded Figure just behind the teleporter at 70,38 and accept "Formal Introductions" then go a tiny bit
--~ north to 71,35 to Tyri and turn it in and accept "A Promising Start"
--~ 150) Now go around the ridge collecting nether dragonkin eggs laying around the crystals then go back to
--~ Tyri and turn it in and accept "Troublesome Distractions"
--~ 151) Ride back west to Protectorate Watch Post at 58,31 and talk to Dabiri next to the nether drake and
--~ turn in "Recipe for Destruction" and accept "On Nethery Wings" then find Viridius walking around and turn
--~ in "Captain Tyralius"
--~ 152) Go to Navuud and turn in "Electro-Shock Goodness!" then to Ameer and turn in "Arconus the
--~ Insatiable"
--~ 153) Go to Hazzin and turn in "Triangulation Point One" accept "Triangulation Point Two" then go to Marid
--~ and talk to him to lure him away and then kill him for "Troublesome Distractions". He has 2 68 guards but
--~ they drop easy
--~ 154) Talk to the nether drake now and he'll fly you up top of Ultris, as it spirals you up, keep tossing the
--~ mana bombs until the void conduit is destroyed. Pretty easy to kill if you spam the bombs. When you land
--~ turn in "On Nethery Wings" SKIP "Dimensius the All-Devouring"
--~ 155) Go east down into the Celestial Ridge again to Tyri at 71,35 and turn in "Troublesome Distractions"
--~ SKIP "Securing the Celestial Ridge"
--~ 156) Hearth to Stormspire then go SW into Manaforge Ara to 28,41 and you should get complete for
--~ "Triangulation Point Two" this spot is near the forge and around mobs so you probably have to run in and
--~ over it. Again I'm not sure if you need to have the mark on it to get the point but I think you do
--~ 157) Now go to Tuluman at Tuluman's Landing at 34,37 and turn it in and SKIP "Full Triangle"
--~ 158) Now head back to Stormspire
--~ 159) Now we go one of 2 places. If you want the skills you can train at 69 go to Shattrath and make it your
--~ home then portal to a town and hearth back. If not, or after getting skills, fly to Allerian Stronghold and
--~ east to the bridge at 71,50 and enter Shadowmoon Valley
