N Aldorks or Scrybabies? |N|You need to pick which faction you will gain rep with.  This is a decision YOU MUST MAKE FOR YOURSELF!  Pop open your web browser, go to wowwiki.com, click on "Aldor v Scryer" on the left, and look at the rewards for each faction.  Make sure you check the quest rewards and crafting recipes as well.  If you choose Scryers then you will have to substitute their quests for the aldor quests in this guide (Scryer guides are on the to do list).|
