|U|29737|
140) Drink Navuud’s Concoction and hit the void wastes to split them into globules for the first part of
"Electro-Shock Goodness!" down in the staging grounds where we’re about to go
141) Go just south of here into the Ethereum Staging Grounds at 56,38 and start killing for "The
Ethereum" Captain Zovax wanders around. Once you're done you have to use the transponder zeta at
56,38 and Ameer will appear. Turn it in and accept "Ethereum Data" then to the south a tiny bit at 55,39
is the data cell, grab it and go turn it in to Ameer at the portal and accept "Potential For Brain Damage=
High"
142) Now you have to kill the guys for their essence. Drink the essence and you have a 30 second buff to
see the fish like relays floating around that you have to kill for the relay data. You should be able to get 1-
2 datas per essence you drink
143) Turn it back in to Ameer at the portal and accept "S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E" then kill an archon or overlord
until you get a prepared ethereum wrapping then go back to the teleporter and turn it in and accept
"Delivering the Message" and protect the demolitionist (easiest way is to either clear it first, or let stuff
attack him. It does that thing where it chases him but doesn’t hit him) then go back to the teleporter and
turn it in and SKIP the next part
144) Just a bit SW there is warden Icoshock, kill him for the key but don't use it on any of the prisons
around him. They're duds. The real prison is just behind the Nexus-King Salhadaar at 53,41 open it for
"Captain Tyralius"
145) Go east to 59,45 and speak with Araxes and accept "The Flesh Lies..." then enter the mine, Access
Shaft Zeon and use the lighter on the withered corpses. Don't get too close or they spawn into parasitic
fleshbeasts. As you enter the tunnel you can go left, keep left until you end up at 60,41 and you'll see Ya
six and the power pack, accept "Arconus the Insatiable" and he’ll give you his hologram to help then grab
the power pack for "A Not-So-Modest Proposal" then go back up towards the entrance and go deeper in,
staying right until you hit the big room at 60,39 and kill Arconus the Insatiable then leave the cave and
return to Araxes just outside at 59,45 and turn in "The Flesh Lies..."
146) Go up around Manaforge Ultris and drink Navuud's Concoction and hit the seeping sludges to split
them into globules for the other part of "Electro-Shock Goodness!" also kill the unstable voidwraiths and
the voidshriekers here for "Recipe for Destruction"
147) Go to 66,33 and you should get the complete message for "Triangulation Point One" if not use the
triangualtion device and a hunters mark will appear where you have to stand
148) Go east into the Celestial Ridge and down the long path through the nether drakes and at the bottom
at 70,39 you'll see the teleporter right as the ramp down ends. Use it and Marid will appear, turn in "A
Not-So-Modest Proposal" accept "Getting Down to Business"
149) Now go around kill any of the nether drakes or dragons for their essence for this then turn it in at the
Shrouded Figure just behind the teleporter at 70,38 and accept "Formal Introductions" then go a tiny bit
north to 71,35 to Tyri and turn it in and accept "A Promising Start"
150) Now go around the ridge collecting nether dragonkin eggs laying around the crystals then go back to
Tyri and turn it in and accept "Troublesome Distractions"
151) Ride back west to Protectorate Watch Post at 58,31 and talk to Dabiri next to the nether drake and
turn in "Recipe for Destruction" and accept "On Nethery Wings" then find Viridius walking around and turn
in "Captain Tyralius"
152) Go to Navuud and turn in "Electro-Shock Goodness!" then to Ameer and turn in "Arconus the
Insatiable"
153) Go to Hazzin and turn in "Triangulation Point One" accept "Triangulation Point Two" then go to Marid
and talk to him to lure him away and then kill him for "Troublesome Distractions". He has 2 68 guards but
they drop easy
154) Talk to the nether drake now and he'll fly you up top of Ultris, as it spirals you up, keep tossing the
mana bombs until the void conduit is destroyed. Pretty easy to kill if you spam the bombs. When you land
turn in "On Nethery Wings" SKIP "Dimensius the All-Devouring"
155) Go east down into the Celestial Ridge again to Tyri at 71,35 and turn in "Troublesome Distractions"
SKIP "Securing the Celestial Ridge"
156) Hearth to Stormspire then go SW into Manaforge Ara to 28,41 and you should get complete for
"Triangulation Point Two" this spot is near the forge and around mobs so you probably have to run in and
over it. Again I'm not sure if you need to have the mark on it to get the point but I think you do
157) Now go to Tuluman at Tuluman's Landing at 34,37 and turn it in and SKIP "Full Triangle"
158) Now head back to Stormspire
159) Now we go one of 2 places. If you want the skills you can train at 69 go to Shattrath and make it your
home then portal to a town and hearth back. If not, or after getting skills, fly to Allerian Stronghold and
east to the bridge at 71,50 and enter Shadowmoon Valley
