TourGuide is an interactive leveling guide addon.
It is designed to provide the user with a streamlined order of quest completion with smart detection.
It is also designed for easy creation of "guides" for users with little-to-no programming knowledge.

h2. Features

* Automatic detection of objective completion
** Detect quest accept, completion and turnin
** Detect travel (by foot, flight, boat and stone)
** Detection of flight point discovery
** Detection of Hearth point change
** Conditionals based on class, level and item possession (only tell the player to accept the quest if they have the item that starts the quest)
* Small "lego block" style frame shows current objective, detailed tooltips on hover
* "Use item" frame, for those annoying quests where you have to use an item on a mob before you kill it, or you have to equip something, or you have to use an item to start a quest
* Pop out frame for detailed view of quest sequence
* Automatic mapping of coordinates with "TomTom":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7032-TomTom.html
* "LDB":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis data feed, for those that would rather use a LDB display than the built in "lego"

h2. How to create (or edit) guides

TourGuide data files are fairly simple to create.
The simplest method is to copy an existing file and edit it how you want.
Please read "How to edit TourGuide guides":http://www.tekkub.net/pages/tourguide_editing for help on the format and general guidelines.
I ask that all submissions follow these guidelines, to present a consistent format to the user.
I welcome all submissions, but reserve the right to edit them as I see fit, or reject ones that infringe upon Joana's, Kopp's or any other copyrighted guide.

See "this page":http://www.tekkub.net/pages/tourguide_bugs for details on how to fork my github repo to push your changes.

<b><i>If you use Joana's or Kopp's as a source <u>do not</u> infringe on their copyrighted material (the notes and comments), I cannot accept guides that are a direct ripoff of their works.</i></b>
